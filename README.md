# Kaggle-Predict-Future-Sales
This challenge serves as final project for the "How to win a data science competition" Coursera course.

<b>However</b> I did the challenge as a side project and here I propose a solution with some EDA, feature engineering and a LGBM model.
Right now I'm ranked at 34% at the public score, and I intend on getting better.

In this competition you will work with a challenging time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, kindly provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. 

We are asking you to predict total sales for every product and store in the next month. By solving this competition you will be able to apply and enhance your data science skills.

### Evaluation Metric
Submissions are evaluated by root mean squared error (RMSE). True target values are clipped into [0,20] range.
